<h1>The Best Games According to Jonas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 games of all-times.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Nier Replicant/Automata</h3> 
<p>This is my favorite games. It offers a unique experience with a story full of deep meaning
    and extraordinary characters. The world building is beautiful, the combat is fluid and fast, and the 
    music is absolutely amazing. I even had the chance to see the Nier orchestra.</p>
<h3>Persona 5</h3>
